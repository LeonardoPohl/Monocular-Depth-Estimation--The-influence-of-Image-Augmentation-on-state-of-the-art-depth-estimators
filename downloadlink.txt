Please download the following files

Download and Paste
https://virutalbuy-public.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/share/newcrfs/models/model_nyu.ckpt
and
https://virutalbuy-public.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/share/newcrfs/models/model_kittieigen.ckpt
into "sourcefiles/Code/checkpoints"

Download
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AysroWpfISmm-yRFGBgFTrLy6FjQwvwP/view
and extract the subfolders (not sync itself) into "sourcefiles/data/nyu"

Run "sourcefiles/data/KITTI/raw_data_downloader.sh", which will download the files into "sourcefiles/data/KITTI/2011_09_26". 
The code was only written to use the drives on that day up to drive 36. So you can either interrupt the scipt once it reaches past 36, 
or adapt the code to read the files automatically.

Finally 
Create an account (or login with an existing one) on http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/user_login.php and download:
http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction
extract the folders into "sourcefiles/data/KITTI/"

Sorry for not automating this.
